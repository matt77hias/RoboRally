## About
RoboRally is a board game where each player plays the role of a robot. The goal of the game is to move the robot from its starting position to the goal position as fast as possible. The first player to reach the goal wins the game. This project creates a game loosely based on this board game supporting *robots*, *boards*, *walls*, *batteries*, *repair kits*, *surprise boxes*, *laser shooting*, a.o. Furthermore, robots can execute small programs (written in a customly defined language).

This project uses *total*, *defensive* and *nominally* programming styles. This project correctly uses *Value classes* to support different unit systems and the *Liskov Substitution Principle* for building hierarchies. Furthermore, all code is documented both *informally* as *formally* using *pre- and postconditions* and *invariants*. All code is nearly fully covered with more than thousand unit tests.
